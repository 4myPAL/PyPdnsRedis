## pdns_redis.py ##

This is a Python glue layer between PowerDNS and Redis.

It knows how to run as a PowerDNS pipe-backend, for replying to arbitary
queries.

It also knows how to run as a command-line tool, for adding and deleting
DNS records to Redis.

For more documentation, please consult the source code (or run the tool
and read the instructions it prints out).
